## runc

`runc` is a client tool for spawning and running containers according to the 
Open Container Initiative (OCI) Specification available at [specs](https://github.com/opencontainers/specs).

OCI is an open governance structure for the express purpose of creating open
industry standards around container formats and runtime.

OCI projects can be found at [projects](https://github.com/opencontainers). 

## Installation (Build and Test)
As `runc` is still in development, there are currently no automated installation
tools or packages available. Instructions to build and run `runc` are located at
[build] (https://github.com/opencontainers/specs/docs/build.md).

## Using runc 
A work in progress user guide for runc is available at [userguide](https://github.com/opencontainers/specs/docs/userguide.md).
